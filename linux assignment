mkdir command ie.this represents  make directory and it  is used to create a directory using the terminal. The following commands were used to create Exercises , python and linux directories repectively.

$ mkdir Exercises

$ mkdir python
 
$ mkdir linux

$ ls -l : This command was used to list horizontally the content of the current Home directory as well as permissions of each file and directory in it.

Current permissons on linux directory are drwxr-xr-x meaning the group others permisions are read and execute ie. r-x and groups permissions are r-x which is read and execute permissions.


$ chmod o-r linux : This command was used to remove read permissions from group others.

$ chmod o-x linux : This command was used to remove execute permissions from group others.

$ chmod g+w linux :To add write to groups permissions 

$ chmod g-x linux :To remove execute from the group permissions the following command was used. 

Hence the linux directory's permissions is now  drwxrw---- which means group others no longer has access; that is group others has permissions ---
Also groups permissions is now read and write only ie. rw-

$ cd linux/ :To change into linux directory 

$ touch myfile_{1..23} : To create 23 empty files named in the required format.
